# Shellcheck Stage - Debian
# We use Debian because 'shellcheck' is not in the main
# Alpine repository now.

shellcheck:
  image: debian:stable-slim
  stage: shellcheck

  before_script:
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install -y make shellcheck

  script:
    - make test


# Bootstrap Stage - Alpine
# This stage is primarily for checking if the 'bootstrap.sh'
# script works. We do not use curl here (as README suggests)
# because the repository where the script is may change.

bootstrap:
  image: alpine:latest
  stage: bootstrap

  before_script:
    - apk update
    - apk add git make ncurses stow

  script:
    - sh ./bootstrap.sh


# Install Stage - Gentoo
# We test if we can run 'make install' on default Gentoo
# image (made from stage3).
# We do not install 'stow' - 'pystow' will be automatically
# installed by 'install_pystow.sh' script that is executed
# by the 'Makefile' (when no other 'stow' implementation
# is available).
# We do not install git because we already have the
# repository initialized (by the GitLab CI) and we can
# use the preinstalled 'wget' to install pystow.

install:
  image: gentoo/stage3-amd64:latest
  stage: install

  script:
    - make install
