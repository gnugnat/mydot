# Make-Install - Gentoo
# We test if we can run 'make install' on default Gentoo
# image (made from stage3).
# We do not install 'stow' - 'pystow' will be automatically
# installed by 'install_pystow.sh' script that is executed
# by the 'Makefile' (when no other 'stow' implementation
# is available).
# We do not install git because we already have the
# repository initialized (by the GitLab CI) and we can
# use the preinstalled 'wget' to install pystow.
