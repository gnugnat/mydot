* Howto

** Dependencies

   You will need:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  bash
  busybox
  git
  make
#+END_SRC

   Optionally you will need a stow implementation, any of:
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]]
   - [[http://xstow.sourceforge.net/][xstow]]
   - [[https://gitlab.com/xgqt/pystow/][pystow]] or python3 (pystow will be installed by =make= if no other stow implementation is found)

** Installation

*** Manual

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir -p ~/source/public/gitlab.com/xgqt
  cd ~/source/public/gitlab.com/xgqt
  git clone --recursive --verbose "https://gitlab.com/xgqt/mydot"
  cd mydot
  bash ./stowdot
#+END_SRC

*** Bootstrap from network

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  curl "https://gitlab.com/xgqt/mydot/-/raw/master/bootstrap.sh" | bash
#+END_SRC


** Uninstallation

   - run =./stowdot remove=

** Selectivity

   You can install/delete configs selectively.
   First change directory to =mydot=.
   Remember to create needed directories to avoid conflicts:
   - =$HOME/.config=        - for your users config files
   - =$HOME/.config/emacs=  - for Emacs

*** install one

    example: zsh
    - =stow -t ~ zsh=

*** uninstall one

    example: zsh
    - =stow -t ~ -D zsh=

** ZSH

    - Run zsh as login shell: =zsh -l=
    - You will be asked which features to enable
